say?</h2>\n  <p>\n    Continent, noun, [ˈkɒn.tɪ.nənt] one of the seven large landmasses on the\n    Earth\'s surface, surrounded, or mainly surrounded, by sea and usually\n    consisting of various countries.\n  </p>\n  <h2>The Continents</h2>\n  <p>\n    Africa, the Americas, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, together with Oceania,\n    and Europe are considered to be continents.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The word continent is used to differentiate between various large land\n    areas of Earth into which all the land surface of the planet is divided.\n    The term refers to the \'mountain top\' regions of the Earth not flooded by\n    water, dry land. The level of the surrounding water ultimately defines the\n    shape and borders of continents. More water implies less land and\n    different outlines. Even more water, like that stored away as ice in the\n    poles and glaciers, and you might live on a water planet, no continents.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    All right, then, a continent is "a large, continuous area of land on\n    Earth." All continents of the Earth together make up about one-third of\n    the total surface of the planet. The fact is, more than two-thirds of the\n    Earth\'s surface is covered by water. The landmasses of the Earth are\n    unequally distributed, two-thirds of the continental landmass is located\n    in the Northern Hemisphere (the upper half of the globe, north of the\n    equator). Why is that? This might be just a feature of our current point\n    in geological time because some million years ago, the bulk of the\n    planet\'s landmass was in the Southern Hemisphere.\n  </p>\n  <p>Go to:</p>\n  <ul>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Africa">Africa</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Americas">The Americas</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Asia">Asia</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Oceania">Australia / Oceania</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Europe">Europe</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Antarctica">Antarctica</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#LandOcean">Land and Ocean</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#Formation">Formation of Continents</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#NewContinents">New Continents</a></li>\n      <li><a href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm#HowmanyContinents">How Many Continents?</a></li>\n  </ul>',countries:'<h2>Countries by Continents</h2>\n  <h3>Asia</h3>\n  <p>Includes 50 countries, and it is the most populated continent, the 60% of the total population of the Earth live\n      here.</p>\n  <h3>Africa</h3>\n  <p>Comprises 54 countries.

They are mostly among the world’s wealthy cities; if not, they are at least among\n      the wealthiest in their nation.</p>\n  <p>Global cities play a key role in the world economy – but the playing field is increasingly unequal. Most cities are\n      not able to engage seriously in global or regional contests for corporate headquarters. Some may be able to attract\n      investment in production, especially where wages are very low. But being far from major trunk transport,\n      communications and other infrastructure prevent them from genuinely competing. </p>\n  <p>There are many lists that rank cities by indicators – such as gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita or housing\n      affordability. Cities are also ranked using composite indicators measuring, for instance, business environment or\n      quality of life (or subsets of this). Some lists relate more directly to ‘global’ or ‘world’ city economies.</p>\n  <p>Here, we look at four of these lists – cities ranked by:</p>\n  <ul>\n      <li>Their concentration of advanced producer services (accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, law)</li>\n      <li>Their number of TNC headquarters and their size and economic performance</li>\n      <li>Scores on global financial

of Paris. It was built for the 1889 World Fair\n      (Universal Expo) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.</p>\n  <p>The 324metres/1062ft high Eiffel Tower was constructed by Auguste Eiffel and a team of engineers. If you would like\n      to take the steps up to the tower viewing platform on the second floor, there are 704 steps to climb, but luckily\n      there are also lifts in each of the leg up to the second floor.</p>\n      <h3>Great Wall of China</h3>\n      <p>The Great Wall is one of the seven wonders of the world. It runs in sections over a very long distance across China.</p>\n      <p>The wall is also referred to as ‘Long Wall’ as it is over 21,196 km/13,171 miles long. It was built with stones, bricks and tiles, earth as well as of wooden material. The wall was completed in 1644, but it took more than 2,000 years to build.</p>\n      <h3>Kremlin in Russia</h3>\n      <p>The Grand Kremlin Palace is part of the Kremlin complex and is located next to the Red Square and St Basil’s Cathedral in Russia’s capital city Moscow.</p>\n      <p>The Kremlin is a fortress with enclosing walls and is built along the Moskva River. The name ‘Kremlin’ means ‘fortress within a city’.
